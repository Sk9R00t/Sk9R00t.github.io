        <p>My Dearest Preety,</p>
        <p>Today, as we celebrate your birthday, I want to take a moment to truly tell you what you mean to me. You are, without a doubt, <b>my most beautiful human being.</b> </p>
        <p>You are so much more than a lover; you are the <b>light of my life</b> the warm, steady glow that guides me through everything. You are my constant <b>inspiration</b>, pushing me to be better, kinder, and happier simply by being you. </p>
        <p>Your smile has a magical way of brightening even the darkest day, and your infectious laugh is my favorite sound in the entire world. When I feel overwhelmed, it is your presence and your steady love that gives me the <b>strength</b> to keep going. You are my home, my confidante, and my greatest adventure. </p>
        <p>Thank you for being born, for choosing me, and for filling my life with a depth of love I never knew was possible. I cherish every moment we share. </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, my darling. May your day be as magnificent as the soul you possess. </p>
        <p class="signature">With all my love,<br>Abid </p>
